# GetRequest
Fetch data from PHP/MySQL

# How to use

Set up a MySQL database.

Create a PHP script which connects to the database.

This should do it. 

Now just change the jsonURL variable in the MainActivity.java file to establish the connection.

If everything works you should see that the textview changes to the returned data from the db.
